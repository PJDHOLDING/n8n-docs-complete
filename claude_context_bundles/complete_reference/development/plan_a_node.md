# Plan a node

This section provides guidance on designing your node, including key technical decisions such as choosing your node building style.

When building a node, there are design choices you need to make before you start:

- Which [node type](node-types/) you need to build.
- Which [node building style](choose-node-method/) to use.
- Your [UI design and UX principles](node-ui-design/)
- Your node's [file structure](../build/reference/node-file-structure/).
