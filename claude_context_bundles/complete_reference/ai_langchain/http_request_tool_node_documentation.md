# HTTP Request Tool node

Legacy tool version

New instances of the HTTP Request tool node that you add to workflows use the standard [HTTP Request](../../../core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.httprequest/) node as a tool. This page is describes the legacy, standalone HTTP Request tool node.

The HTTP Request tool works just like the [HTTP Request](../../../core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.httprequest/) node, but it's designed to be used with an [AI agent](../../../../../glossary/#ai-agent) as a tool to collect information from a website or API.

Credentials

Refer to [HTTP Request credentials](../../../credentials/httprequest/) for guidance on setting up authentication.

Parameter resolution in sub-nodes

Sub-nodes behave differently to other nodes when processing multiple items using an expression.

Most nodes, including root nodes, take any number of items as input, process these items, and output the results. You can use expressions to refer to input items, and the node resolves the expression for each item in turn. For example, given an input of five `name` values, the expression `{{ $json.name }}` resolves to each name in turn.

In sub-nodes, the expression always resolves to the first item. For example, given an input of five `name` values, the expression `{{ $json.name }}` always resolves to the first name.
