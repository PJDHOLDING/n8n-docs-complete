# Troubleshooting SAML SSO

If you get an error when testing your SAML setup, check the following:

- Does the app you created in your IdP support SAML?
- Did you enter the n8n redirect URL and entity ID in the correct fields in your IdP?
- Is the metadata XML correct? Check that the metadata you copied into n8n is formatted correctly.
