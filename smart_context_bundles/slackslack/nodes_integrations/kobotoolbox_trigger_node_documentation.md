# KoboToolbox Trigger node

[KoboToolbox](https://www.kobotoolbox.org/) is a field survey and data collection tool to design interactive forms to be completed offline from mobile devices. It's available both as a free cloud solution or as a self-hosted version.

Credentials

You can find authentication information for this node [here](../../credentials/kobotoolbox/).

Examples and templates

For usage examples and templates to help you get started, refer to n8n's [KoboToolbox Trigger integrations](https://n8n.io/integrations/kobotoolbox-trigger/) page.

This node starts a workflow upon new submissions of a specified form. The trigger node handles the creation/deletion of the hook, so you don't need to do any setup in KoboToolbox.

It works the same way as the Get Submission operation in the [KoboToolbox](../../app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.kobotoolbox/) node, including supporting the same reformatting options.
