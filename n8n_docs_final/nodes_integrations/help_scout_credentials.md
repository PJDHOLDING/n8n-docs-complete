## Using OAuth2

Note for n8n Cloud users

Cloud users don't need to provide connection details. Select **Connect my account** to connect through your browser.

If you need to configure OAuth2 from scratch or need more detail on what's happening in the OAuth web flow, you'll need to create a Help Scout app. Refer to the instructions in the [Help Scout OAuth documentation](https://developer.helpscout.com/mailbox-api/overview/authentication/#oauth2-application) for more information.
