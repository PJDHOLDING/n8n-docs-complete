# Install and manage community nodes

There are three ways to install community nodes:

- Within n8n using the [nodes panel](verified-install/) (for verified community nodes only).
- Within n8n [using the GUI](gui-install/): Use this method to install community nodes from the npm registry.
- [Manually from the command line](manual-install/): use this method to install community nodes from npm if your n8n instance doesn't support installation through the in-app GUI.

Installing from npm only available on self-hosted instances

Unverified community nodes aren't available on n8n cloud and require [self-hosting](../../../hosting/) n8n.
