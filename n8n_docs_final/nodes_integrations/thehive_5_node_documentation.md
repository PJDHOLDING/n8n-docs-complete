# TheHive 5 node

Use the TheHive 5 node to automate work in TheHive, and integrate TheHive with other applications. n8n has built-in support for a wide range of TheHive features, including creating alerts, counting tasks logs, cases, and observables.

TheHive and TheHive 5

n8n provides two nodes for TheHive. Use this node (TheHive 5) if you want to use TheHive's version 5 API. If you want to use version 3 or 4, use [TheHive](../n8n-nodes-base.thehive/).

Credentials

Refer to [TheHive credentials](../../credentials/thehive5/) for guidance on setting up authentication.
